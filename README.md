# DP-GST
To preserve privacy during GST search,we propose a novel GST solver which integrates graph neural networks with diffusion-based generative modeling to find GSTs under privacy-preserving settings. In particular, we design a new GST-customized score network to guide the reverse diffusion process using neighborhoodaware representations.
